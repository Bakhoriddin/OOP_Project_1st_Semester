This program is something like "bank simulator" with integrated database
This archive consists of 2 parts:
1) Program - folder "Program" where you can find ready aplication after static release. which means that you don't have to install additional software, because everything is already installed inside the folder
2) Code - folder "Code" where you can find whole code of the project and inspect it if you have C++ already installed on your computer
